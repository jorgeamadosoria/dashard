# Dashard
The Dashboard for Arduino is a Java webapp designed to receive updates from Arduino devices and show their status on a Dashboard. It can also convey information to said devices by exposing variables in REST endpoints that can be read in a polling fashion.
This app was created for a very specific set of circumstances that did not take security in consideration that do not apply anymore. Regardless, the app works as intended and can be used as is, as long as there aren't high expectations for its functionality.
